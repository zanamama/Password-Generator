# Password-Generator

PASSWORD GENERATOR

## My Task

Welcome to my 2nd week's 2nd homework assignment! I'm going to be creating a password generator from scratch! I will be adding code as I progress along in the course in order to fine-tune a great password generator file that is functional and stylish.

I will be applying the core skills I learned this week, such as Arrays, Strings, Booleans, and if/else statements.

## Acceptance Criteria (copied)

1. Password Generator gives us a random password
2. User Specifies the password criteria

- Have user choose between:
- Length of Password (8-128)
- Upper Case
- Special Characters
- Numbers
- Lower Case

3. Computer derives a random password with user's specifications.
